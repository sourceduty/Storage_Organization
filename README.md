### Example Usage

![Tesla Parking Lots](https://github.com/sourceduty/Storage_Organization/assets/123030236/19f4c59f-145c-4434-8afd-9b7589920639)

Tesla Gigafactory 2 Parking Lot Analysis (1339 South Park Ave, Buffalo, NY 14220, United States)

Total Spaces: 100 (estimated)
Occupied Spaces: 23
Occupancy Rate: 23.00%

Observations:

1. Occupancy Rate: The parking lot is currently about 23% occupied, indicating that there is ample available space.
2. Distribution: Most of the occupied spaces are clustered towards the top left corner of the lot.
3. Accessibility: There is a designated handicapped space at the bottom left corner, which appears to be occupied.

Potential Areas for Improvement:

1. Redistribution of Parking Spaces: Consider redistributing the spaces to avoid clustering and encourage more even usage across the lot.
2. Signage and Directions: Improve signage and markings to guide drivers to available spaces, particularly in less utilized areas.
3. Specialized Parking Areas: Introduce areas for compact cars, electric vehicle charging stations, or additional handicapped spaces if needed.
4. Efficiency Enhancements: Reassess the layout to see if the number of spaces can be increased without compromising accessibility and safety.
