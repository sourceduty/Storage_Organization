Theoretical Abstraction Model for Storage Organization

Theoretical storage unit organization hierarchy model.

The storage organization hierarchy organizes storage units into levels, each level representing an increasing degree of granularity or detail. At the top level are broad categories that encompass many specific items. As you move down through the levels, the categories become more narrow and specific until you reach individual units at the bottom level. The hierarchical structure can be automated by using a metaprogramming approach to define rules for how data should be organized into different levels of granularity based on certain criteria or patterns in the data itself. The metaprogramming layer allows for flexible and dynamic organization schemes without requiring manual intervention after the initial setup. It enables defining new rules as needed, adjusting existing ones, or even generating entirely novel hierarchical structures from scratch simply by modifying the underlying code that defines how data is organized into levels of granularity based on certain criteria or patterns in the data itself

```
1. Units of storage.
2. A bulk hierarchical structure of storage unit organization.
3. Automated bulk hierarchical structure of storage unit organization.
4. Meta-automation of the bulk hierarchical structure of storage unit organization.
```

Notes:

- Data is organized hierarchically with increasing detail at each level 
- This hierarchy can be automated using metaprogramming to define rules for organizing units based on attributes, relationships etc. 
- The automation layer allows flexible and dynamic organization schemes that adapt as needed without manual intervention after initial setup.
- Items with similar attributes (e.g., all books) could automatically group together at one level, while items within that category are further divided by author name/title etc. 
- Temporal relationships between units can also be used to create hierarchies based on time periods or sequences of events.
